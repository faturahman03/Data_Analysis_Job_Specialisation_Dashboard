# Data_Analysis_Job_Specialisation_Dashboard
This project analyzes Data Analysis Job Specializations across Asia–Pacific using open-source data from Kaggle.
It includes full data processing with SQL, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Excel, and an interactive dashboard summarizing job distribution, average salary, and work modes.
Insights reveal significant salary gaps (notably in Australia), a dominance of remote jobs (73%), and a clear correlation between job level and salary.
The final dashboard visualizes salary trends, country comparisons, and key job metrics for data analyst roles.
Created as a portfolio project to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling through data.
